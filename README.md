# MouseFeatureVectors
Combos of fourier, decay, and other math to preprocess mouse movements for use in neuralnets

v0.1 displays in realtime a 300x300 grid of horizontal is frequency and vertical is decay, and big numbers are wrapped, though in future versions I hope to norm it better and just provide the wrapping as an option.
